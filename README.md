We want to use a custom D3 creative project to map incidents of wildfires in North America. The D3/Leaflet visualization will plot wildfires incidents and include interactive filters to show fire size, damages, etc.  

A few "new" JavaScript libraries that we will consider exploring incude:

1. ZeeMaps
2. Echarts for interactive visualisation
3. Recharts (bar graphs)
4. Kartograph

Data in our SQL library will include:

A. Date of reported fire
B. Size of fire (acres)
C. Cost of fire containment 
D. Total damages (residential, federal, land, wildlife, etc.)
